# Azure DevOps Learning Path and its Related Projects

# First step:
1. Understanding the basics of the cloud and its types
2. cloud computing?
3. Exploring Azure and its account creation
4. difference between Iaas vs SaaS vs PaaS

# Projects:
1. Creating the VM and VNet.
2. Deploying the application behind firewall on azure
3. Migrating the Vote App from Github to Azure DevOps with CI/CD Pipelines.

# 3. GitHub to Azure DevOps Vote App Migration with CI/CD
Migrating the "Vote App" from GitHub to Azure DevOps with CI/CD Pipelines can be an excellent project to showcase your skills in version control, infrastructure management, and continuous integration/continuous deployment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can approach this project:

  1. **Set up Azure DevOps Account**:
   - Create an account on Azure DevOps if you haven't already.
   - Create a new project in Azure DevOps to host your Vote App.

  2. **Import Vote App from GitHub**:
   - In your Azure DevOps project, navigate to Repositories.
   - Choose "Import" and select "Git" as the source type.
   - Provide the URL of your Vote App GitHub repository and import it into Azure DevOps.

  3. **Configure CI Pipeline**:
   - Set up a CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline in Azure DevOps to automatically build the Vote App whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
   - Configure the CI pipeline to use appropriate build agents and define build steps such as package installation, compilation, and testing.

  4. **Configure CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up a CD (Continuous Deployment) pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the deployment of the Vote App to your target environment (e.g., Azure App Service) after a successful build.
   - Define deployment stages, environments, and deployment tasks in the CD pipeline.
   - Integrate any necessary approval gates or manual interventions into the deployment process.

  5. **Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Use Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to define the infrastructure required for hosting the Vote App (e.g., virtual machines, databases).
   - Store the IaC templates alongside your application code in the repository.

  6. **Integrate IaC with CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Incorporate the IaC deployment process into your CI/CD pipelines to ensure that infrastructure changes are applied consistently alongside application updates.
   - Trigger infrastructure provisioning/deprovisioning as part of the deployment process.

  7. **Test and Validate**:
   - Test the CI/CD pipelines thoroughly to ensure that they build and deploy the Vote App correctly.
   - Validate the deployed application to ensure that it functions as expected in the target environment.

  8. **Document and Showcase**:
   - Document the migration process, including configuration settings, pipeline definitions, and any challenges faced.
   - Showcase your project on your resume, providing details of your role, the technologies used, and the outcomes achieved.
